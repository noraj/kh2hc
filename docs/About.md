# About

## Presentation

You can find my presentation **Cracking hashed known_hosts** on [github](https://github.com/Acceis/prez-known_hosts) ([Online slideshow](https://acceis.github.io/prez-known_hosts/) - [PDF](https://github.com/Acceis/prez-known_hosts/releases/download/v1.0.0/slides.pdf).)

## Why?

**kh2hc** tool is a more robust alternative to [PoC script](https://github.com/chris408/known_hosts-hashcat/blob/master/kh-converter.py). kh2hc is documented, is not only CLI but has a library too, the lib offer more methods, etc. and will be properly maintained an distributed (Rubygems, BlackArch, etc.)
